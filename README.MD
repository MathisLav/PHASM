#PHASM

###Features :
	Works on Ti-84+CE and Ti-83 Premium CE
	Executes archived (sub-)programs 
	Executes assembly (sub-)programs (without the Asm( suffix)
	Allows you to jump to any Lbl you want in pressing [Alpha]+[X,T,O,n] in the program editor
	Allows you to edit archived program
	Includes a Memory Editor. Just press [Alpha]+[VAR] to edit an AppVar or the raw memory (PLEASE READ THE MEMEDIT-README)
	Languages available : English and French. Feel free to ask me if you want to add a language!

###Setup :
To use PHASM, send PHASM.8XG and PHASM.8XP. It's pointless to ungroup PHASM.8XG. Then, run Asm(prgmPHASM) and that's all there is to it! To uninstall PHASM, just run prgmPHASM.
/!\ Do not delete or archive the AppVar created during the installation. It will trigger an error each time you will need it /!\

##New :
	You'll not see anymore some weird programs like prgmTTEMP in your Programs List!
	If you chose the French Language in your calculator, PHASM will detect it and display French texts
	Several bugs fixed (TXTLIB bug, memory leaks, vars corruption)
	Added a Memory Editor
	ERRORS : You can now choose "GoTo" in an error even if the program you want to edit is archived
	Optimizations...

Have fun!
