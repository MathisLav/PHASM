#PHASM

##Features
	
PHASM is a hook. A hook is a code which is executed when a specific event occurs. It works on Ti-84+CE (or Ti-83 Premium CE).
Thanks to PHASM, you can run archived and assembly [sub-]programs as Basic programs! Furthermore, it's enough to press [Alpha] [X,T,O,n] to display a menu which allows you to go to any Lbl you want in the program editor instantly. And, you will also be able to edit archived program. You can use PHASM and Cesium at the same time, they are compatible.


##Setup

To use PHASM, you have to send PHASM.8XG and PHASM.8XP. It's pointless to ungroup PHASM.8XG. Then, run Asm(prgmPHASM) and that's all there is to it! To uninstall PHASM, just run prgmPHASM.

/!\ Do not delete or archive the AppVar created during the installation. It will disable PHASM /!\

##NEW :
* It executes assembly/archived sub-programs
* PHASM has been translated into english
* Several bugs fixed

*Have fun!*
